# Test Bookstore App

This is an app you can use to practice your automation testing skills (for example with Selenium). It's build on Wordpress so you're going to need both Wordpress files and mysql database (populated with data).

You can deploy it locally using Docker. Just use docker-compose.yml and run docker-compose command to have your test web app set up in seconds.

## How to deploy
### Install Docker
More information on how to do it [here](https://www.docker.com/).
### Copy docker-compose.yml
Copy docker-compose.yml (from docker-test-bookstore folder) and paste it into newly created folder.
### Run docker compose
In the command line go to the folder where you have docker-compose.yml. Then run `docker compose up -d`. Your local application will persist changes you might introduce (for example db changes, like adding new products). If you need a fresh app, just create another folder with docker-compose.yml in it and run docker compose command again.


## Useful info
### Admin panel
If you want to login to Wordpress admin panel (localhost:8080/wp-admin), use admin/admin.
### phpMyAdmin
To login to phpMyAdmin (localhost:8000), use wordpress/wordpress.
### Testing Cards
Payments are in test mode and set up with Stripe. You can use Stripe test cards to perform a payment. You'll find them [here](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards).
### REST API
REST API keys for API testing (read/write):

Consumer key: ck_a13ac568ad5104c9c8906e20447f3f0672656d60

Consumer secret: cs_d2e37250406cf283259737c247095bdd867549bc

### Mobile
If you want to access the app from your mobile device in the same network, you need to change URL settings of the app to the internal IP and port 8080. First, check what is the internal IP of the host. Then go to [http://localhost:8080/wp-admin/options-general.php](http://localhost:8080/wp-admin/options-general.php) (admin/admin) and change WordPress Address (URL) and Site Address (URL) to http://your_internal_ip:80808. 

Keep in mind that your internal IP might change later. In that case you won't be able to reach the app anymore. To fix it open phpMyAdmin (http://localhost:8000). login with wordpress/wordpress and click on "wordpress" database on the left. Next choose wp_options table and change "siteurl" and "home" back to http://localhost:8080 or to your new internal ip and a port number. Then go back to [http://localhost:8080/wp-admin/options-general.php](http://localhost:8080/wp-admin/options-general.php) and click "Save" button to make sure all the URL in the app were updated.
